- Once the player reaches the water, you will start the next level
- Higher level means more bugs!
- You got 3 lives (hearts)
- Try to collect gems that will appear randomly
- Collecting a gem will decrease the nubmer of bugs (only if bugs are more than 3)
- Try to beat your previously highest level achieved
